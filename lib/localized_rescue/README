Localized rescue
----------------

This feature extends Rails rescue handling and allows the use of localized
rescues like <code>en-US/404.html</code> on the public dir. The plugin will
then pick the rescue page matching the currently used locale
(<code>I18n#locale</code>).

If the localized rescue page isn't found, the plugin will render the
<code>404.html</code> file if it exists.
