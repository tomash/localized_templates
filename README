LocalizedTemplates
License: MIT
Version: 0.4

Description
==================

This plugin uses Rails I18n (http://rails-i18n.org/) to allow templates localization.
You can localize your views using the following naming convention:

  <tt>pt-BR/projects/index.html.erb</tt>
  <tt>en-US/projects/edit.rss.builder</tt>
  
And you can also localize rescue files:

  <tt>public/pt-BR/404.html</tt>
  <tt>public/en-US/404.html</tt>

If you don't want to localize a file (like a xml file), simply don't move it and it will be
rendered as default to all languages.

This is an alternative to Rails 2.3 templates localization schema. If you are
localizing almost all of your views, it definitely suits you better because
your views will be better organized.

=================
