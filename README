LocalizedTemplates
==================

This plugin uses Rails I18n (http://rails-i18n.org/) to allow templates localization.
You can localize your views using the following naming convention:

  <tt>pt-BR/projects/index.html.erb</tt>
  <tt>en-US/projects/edit.rss.builder</tt>
  
And you can also localize rescue files:

  <tt>public/pt-BR/404.html</tt>
  <tt>public/en-US/404.html</tt>

If you don't want to localize a file (like a xml file), simply don't move it and it will be
rendered as default to all languages.

Installation
=================

Install LocalizedTemplates is very easy. It is stored in GitHub, so if you have
never installed a gem via GitHub run the following:

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

Then install the gem:

  sudo gem install josevalim-localized_templates

In RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rb:

  config.gem "josevalim-localized_templates",  :lib => "localized_templates", :source => "http://gems.github.com"

If you want it as plugin, just do:

    cd myapp
    git clone git://github.com/josevalim/localized_templates.git
    rm -rf vendor/plugins/localized_templates/.git

Adding a new locale
=================

To add a new locale, simply create a new file in config/locales. You can make your life easier by copying an existing
locale and basing your new locale on it.

Check installed locales
=================

To display a list of all locales installed in config/locales, you can use the following rake command:

  rake locales

Changing the default locale
=================

If you want to use a default locale other than en-US, you have to tell the i18n plugin the locale you want to use by
default. Simply put the following line in an initializer in config/initializers or include it in your environment.rb:

    I18n.default_locale = 'de-AT'
